# Emojithings

An [Alfred App](http://www.alfredapp.com/) workflow that puts your favorite (completely useless but fun) ASCII emoji right at your fingertips. It will make all your friends go crazy and ʕノ•ᴥ•ʔノ ︵ ┻━┻ in no time :)

## Usage

Just type "emo" a space and a searchword into Alfred after you've installed the workflow.

## Extending

All emojis are stored locally in a file called "emoji_db" inside the workflow folder. The format is simple: first comes the search term under which you wish to find your emoji, then one or more tabs, and then the emoji. One emoji per line.

To find the workflow folder open your Alfred preferences, right-click on the workflow and select "Show in Finder".
